Currently messing around with using RedwoodJS, Apollo, GraphQL&Prisma, Serverless Functions, and JAMStack APIs & services more on my free time. I'm procrastinating getting the CSS Grid updates and Chakra-UI down efficiently.

as a side project I'm currently working on a social network built with Node.js, Express, Apollo Server, Mongoose/MongoDB, GraphQL for the [Backend/API](https://github.com/hyliancoder/local-api) hosted on Heroku. React (including Hooks, Context, and Suspense), Apollo Client, GraphQL, and a handful of node packages for the [Frontend](https://github.com/hyliancoder/local-frontend) hosted on Netlify. Currently working on migrating it over to RedwoodJS.
