Currently messing around with using Gatsby, GraphQL, and JAMStack services more on my free time. I'm procrastinating getting CSS Grid down efficiently.

At work I'm currently working on a social network built with Node.js, Express, Apollo Server, Mongoose/MongoDB, GraphQL for the Backend/API hosted on Heroku. React (implementing Hooks has been fun), Apollo Client, GraphQL, and a handful of node packages for the frontend hosted on Netlify.
