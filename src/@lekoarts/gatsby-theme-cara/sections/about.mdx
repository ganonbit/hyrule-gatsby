Currently messing around with using Gatsby, GraphQL, and JAMStack services more on my free time. I'm procrastinating getting CSS Grid down efficiently.

at my job I'm currently working on a SaaS product mainly based in React+Redux with a Python backend.

as a side project I'm currently working on a social network built with Node.js, Express, Apollo Server, Mongoose/MongoDB, GraphQL for the [Backend/API](https://github.com/hyliancoder/local-api) hosted on Heroku. React (implementing Hooks has been fun), Apollo Client, GraphQL, and a handful of node packages for the [frontend](https://github.com/hyliancoder/local-frontend) hosted on Netlify.
